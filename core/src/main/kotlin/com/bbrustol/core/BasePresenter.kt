/**
 * BasePresenter is an abstract class that serves as a base for implementing the MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern in the project.
 * It utilizes the ViewModel architecture component to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. The presenter handles
 * events, updates UI state, and manages side effects using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow.
 *
 * @param <Event> Type representing user actions or events that trigger changes in the UI state.
 * @param <UiState> Type representing the state of the UI, often modeled as either data class, sealed class
 * or sealed interface, depending on the UI and logic specs.
 * @param <SideEffect> Type representing one-time actions or effects, such as navigation or showing
 * a toast. Once the receiver consumes the event, it is gone.
